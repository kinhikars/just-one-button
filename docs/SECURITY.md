# Security Policy

This project treats security as a first-class concern, regardless of its size or apparent simplicity.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it responsibly by contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub.

Reports should include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if applicable
- Any relevant logs or proof of concept

## Scope

This project intentionally has a very small surface area. That does not reduce the expectation of correctness.

Security considerations include, but are not limited to:
- Server-side enforcement of all limits and entitlements
- Payment verification handled exclusively on the server
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Minimal data retention
- No unnecessary exposure of internal state

## Disclosure

Responsible disclosure is appreciated. Verified issues will be addressed with priority.
